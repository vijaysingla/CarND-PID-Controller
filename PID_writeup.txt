In this project, a twiddle algorithm (gradient descent) was developed to tune the PID controller for car driving simulator. Intially , PID gains were tuned using trial and error. 
Proportional gain increases the responsiveness of the system. Intially, kp was tuned and ki and kd were set to zero. After getting good responsiveness from the system, Kd was tuned to stabilize the system and reduce oscillations. Having high Kd can also unstabailize the system. Integral gain is basically used to reduce the steady state error. For the trial and error method, Ki was always set to zero. 

A twidlle algorithm (gradient descent) algorithm was developed to auto-tune the PID controller. THe algorithm was initialized with some reasonable gains and delta_gains (dp). A gain i is ncremented by dp and error is checked for fixed time of simualtion run.  If error is decreased, then the gains are updated to new gains  and gain_delta is incremented by 1.1 for next run. If error is increased, then the original gain is decreased by dp , and error is checked again. After employing this,If error is decreased, then the gains are updated to new gains  and gain_delta is incremented by 1.1 for next run, otherwise the original gain is maintained and dp is decreased by 0.9 for next run. This process is repeated till sum of dp for P,I and D reaches a defined tolerance value. After each run of gain tuning, integral error was reset . Special intenion should be paid to integral error as there is always a chance of integral windup that can unstabilize the system. Different anti-integral windup menthods can be employed to take care of this.
